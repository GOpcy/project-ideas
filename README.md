# Ideas for projects

# Advanced Golang Project Ideas

## **Concurrency & Channels**
### 1. Parallel Web Scraper
- Extend your existing scraper to handle multiple pages concurrently.
- Use **goroutines + channels** to process multiple URLs at the same time.
- Implement a worker pool pattern.

### 2. Distributed URL Shortener
- Upgrade your **URL shortener** project into a **distributed service** with multiple instances communicating.
- Learn about **gRPC, concurrency, and load balancing**.
- Store short URLs in a **distributed key-value store** like **etcd**.

### 3. Load Balancer
- Build a simple **HTTP load balancer** that distributes requests to multiple backend servers.
- Implement **round-robin or least connections algorithms** using Go’s concurrency model.

### 4. Concurrent File Downloader
- Split large files into chunks and download them concurrently.
- Use **goroutines, worker pools, and channels**.
- Implement retry logic and download resumption.

## **System Tools**
### 5. System Resource Monitor (like `htop`)
- Track **CPU, RAM, disk, network usage** in real-time.
- Use **Go's `runtime` package** to get system stats.
- Build a **CLI interface** using a library like **`tview` or `termui`**.

### 6. Key-Value Database (Mini Redis)
- Implement an in-memory **key-value store** that supports **GET, SET, DELETE** commands.
- Use **Go’s `sync.Map` for concurrency**.
- Add a **TCP or HTTP interface** for clients.
- Implement **persistence** (write logs to disk).

### 7. Static Code Analyzer for Go (Like `golangci-lint`)
- Write a CLI tool that scans Go code and detects **inefficient code patterns**.
- Use **Go's `go/parser` package** to analyze AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).

---

## **Networking & WebSockets**
### 8. Terminal-Based Chat App (WebSockets & CLI UI)
- Implement a **WebSocket server** in Go.
- Clients will connect via a **CLI interface** (like Slack for terminals).
- Learn **channels** for handling multiple connections.

### 9. P2P File Sharing System
- Build a simple **peer-to-peer file sharing** system.
- Use **WebSockets, TCP, or gRPC** to communicate.
- Learn how to use **Goroutines & Mutexes** to handle concurrent transfers.

---

## **Security & Cryptography**
### 10. Password Manager (CLI + Encryption)
- Store passwords in an **encrypted** local database.
- Use **AES encryption** (`crypto/aes`).
- Implement a CLI interface for adding/retrieving passwords.

### 11. VPN or Proxy Server
- Build a **simple VPN** using **Go’s net package**.
- Use **encryption** to create a secure tunnel.
- Learn **how TCP/UDP networking works**.

### 12. Secure Chat App (End-to-End Encryption)
- Encrypt messages with **AES or RSA** before sending via WebSockets.
- Implement secure **key exchange** (Diffie-Hellman).
- Learn **TLS and secure communications** in Go.

---

## **Compilers & Low-Level Programming**
### 13. Tiny Golang Virtual Machine (Like a mini-JVM)
- Implement a stack-based **bytecode interpreter**.
- Write an assembler to compile simple programs into bytecode.
- Learn about **parsing, memory management, and execution models**.

### 14. Embedded Web Server (Without Using `net/http`)
- Build an HTTP server **from scratch** using raw TCP sockets.
- Implement **request parsing, routing, and response handling**.
- Learn about **how HTTP servers work internally**.

---

## **Game Development**
### 15. Multiplayer Game (Goroutines + WebSockets)
- Make a simple **multiplayer turn-based game** (like Chess or Tic-Tac-Toe).
- Use **WebSockets for real-time communication**.
- Handle multiple players using **Goroutines & Channels**.

### 16. Game AI Bot
- Train a bot to play **Tetris or Space Invaders**.
- Use **Reinforcement Learning** (Q-Learning).
- Implement decision-making using **Go routines for concurrent processing**.
