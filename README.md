- Implement **persistence** (write logs to disk).

#### Static Code Analyzer for Go (Like `golangci-lint`)
- Write a CLI tool that scans Go code and detects **inefficient code patterns**.
- Use **Go's `go/parser` package** to analyze AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).

---

### 1.3 Networking & WebSockets
#### Terminal-Based Chat App (WebSockets & CLI UI)
- Implement a **WebSocket server** in Go.
- Clients will connect via a **CLI interface** (like Slack for terminals).
- Learn **channels** for handling multiple connections.

#### P2P File Sharing System
- Build a simple **peer-to-peer file sharing** system.
- Use **WebSockets, TCP, or gRPC** to communicate.
- Learn how to use **Goroutines & Mutexes** to handle concurrent transfers.

---

### 1.4 Security & Cryptography
#### Password Manager (CLI + Encryption)
- Store passwords in an **encrypted** local database.
- Use **AES encryption** (`crypto/aes`).
- Implement a CLI interface for adding/retrieving passwords.

#### VPN or Proxy Server
- Build a **simple VPN** using **Go’s net package**.

- Learn **how TCP/UDP networking works**.

#### Secure Chat App (End-to-End Encryption)
- Encrypt messages with **AES or RSA** before sending via WebSockets.
- Implement secure **key exchange** (Diffie-Hellman).
- Learn **TLS and secure communications** in Go.

---

### 1.5 Compilers & Low-Level Programming
#### Tiny Golang Virtual Machine (Like a mini-JVM)
- Implement a stack-based **bytecode interpreter**.
- Write an assembler to compile simple programs into bytecode.
- Learn about **parsing, memory management, and execution models**.

#### Embedded Web Server (Without Using `net/http`)
- Build an HTTP server **from scratch** using raw TCP sockets.
- Implement **request parsing, routing, and response handling**.
- Learn about **how HTTP servers work internally**.

---

### 1.6 Game Development
#### Multiplayer Game (Goroutines + WebSockets)
- Make a simple **multiplayer turn-based game** (like Chess or Tic-Tac-Toe).
- Use **WebSockets for real-time communication**.
- Handle multiple players using **Goroutines & Channels**.

#### Game AI Bot
- Train a bot to play **Tetris or Space Invaders**.
- Use **Reinforcement Learning** (Q-Learning).
- Implement decision-making using **Go routines for concurrent processing**.
